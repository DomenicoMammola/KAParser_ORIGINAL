# KAParser_ORIGINAL
KAParser component for Delphi/C++Builder.
 
Originally developed by Vijainder K Thakur [(his blog)](http://thumkar.blogspot.in/).

Some files from the original codebase were missed, however Vijainder has allowed me to release as open source what he was able to found of the original package.

A reimplementation for Delphi and FPC is available in the [Mommon](https://github.com/DomenicoMammola/Mommon) library.
